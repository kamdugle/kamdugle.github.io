A simple web app to allow users to search for general top picks in a neigbhorhood, or to search for specific types of locales.

## Getting Started

The webpage can be accessed through the github URL https://kamdugle.github.io/src/index.html in a modern web browser. The webpage can also be downloaded from Github locally, and run from a local server if desired.

### Prerequisities

A modern web browser and an internet connection are required.

## How to Use

A default neighborhood with placeholder locations should load initially. The first list shows the current neighborhood, as well as a list of results if a search has already been peformed. New neighborhoods can be searched by entering neighbhorhood name, city, and state. User also has the option of providing a specific search query once a neighborhood has been selected, and clicking the Search button. 

Once the neigbhorhood has been changed, the user can select places to view to see address, map location, and reviews by clicking the View button. The user can also select multiple places and click save to save it to the saved places list below with the Save button..

Places in the saved places list can be filtered with simple text strings. They can also be removed or viewed with the Remove and View buttons. Once the neighborhood is changed, this list will be lost.
